eLabTraining1
=============

Beginning of eLab training 2014

We will use TDD to develop the data model for a learning game. The game is one that has been developed for teaching simple Math to elementary students.  There would normally be work on the interface as well as the data structure but we will beging with the ddata structure as this is an easier route.

The work will be done in pairs with the process being modelled starting in the first period after a description by the customer.  We will also try to link it all to Travis CI for Continuos Integration Testing
